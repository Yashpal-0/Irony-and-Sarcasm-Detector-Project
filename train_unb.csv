2042,i prefer it  im a texan and a while back i had a horrible kidney stone but i didnt know what it was because i had never had one before i went to the er in excruciating pain and they treated me wonderfully   i got three count em baby three shots of morphine through an iv that is an experience i have never had before but enjoyed and would recommend  then i left with a handful of prescriptions after a ct scan is that right  some kind of scan  and went home and was high as a kite for a few days and then it passed and we were all good again  woo   so then the bill comes and its   so at first i was all like woah shit so i called and complained because while in the er i had specifically ask repeatedly how much the scan would cost and had repeatedly had my question refused to be answered by the doctors nurses radiologists or whatever theyre called and even the lady who came in to get my personal info and ask me for a credit card to pay as much as i could afford right now i authorized  because she wouldnt explain to me what exactly it was i was paying for right now and i finally decided they just wanted a card on file   sooo when the bill comes the scan alone was  bucks just the scan the entire rest of my treatment was only  which i would probably have paid gladly after the wonderful care i got and i knew i was uninsured going into this and i knew ers are expensive and at the time i was in horrible pain and scared shitless by it so i didnt care  i made my choices and would live with them but  grand for just the scan  that seemed unreasonable to me and i also found out later that scans like that arent necessary for kidney stones and often arent done unless youre peeing blood so wtf   so this is where the fun starts i called to complain about this scan cost i was quite clear that i would pay a reasonable about for my care and was happy with my care but i couldnt afford  total and that k for the scan was nuts so they ask me to fill out some paperwork to see if i qualified for financial relief from my bill  i explained again that i didnt want charity i just wanted a reasonable bill and btw  for the three shots of morhpine and the  minutes the doctor spent with me seems a little out of whack too  of that is called an er fee and is apparently a charge you get just for walking into the er regardless of what happens next but hey they took good care of me and i dont know what the fuck morphine costs   anyway the only option i had was to file for the charitable relief well ya see i am currently a stay at home uncle my brother abandoned his two kids with our mom she cant afford day care you would not fucking believe how expensive day care is and since i made less money than she does i become the stay at home parent  we all live together now she pays the bills and i take care of the kids  it was weird at first but its actually kinda rewarding and fun now most of the time  so technically im single with no income and have been for about a year and a half now and my tax returns reflect that  actually do have some income for contract it work with people who knew me before i quit its all under the table though   soooo i got full relief  i actually have some money and my mother actually makes ok money and we were willing to pay a reasonable amount for the bill my hope was to reduce it by half to k and pay it out over time lower is better of course but i had braced myself to accept  grand if i could negotiate hard enough to get there  instead i paid   and i learned a valuable lesson if it looks like you have no money you can go to the er for freeeeee  wee   so suck it tax payers i ripped you off for  bucks and i have three pain pills left over for a rainy day   now stupid obamacare is going to make me pay for my own insurance  boooo thats going to be like  a month  every month  you even have to pay in december  come on government its baby jesus birthday fucking dicks,1

2649, minimum wage isnt supposed to be livable   you know id be fine arguing this one if we werent in the current economic situation were in   minimum wage jobs were supposed to be for kids working their first jobs part time to get some entrylevel work experience under their belt   everyones got to start someplace right   or theyre for moms of schoolage kids who need extra spending money and a flexible schedule of am  pm   or theyre for retirees who have investment income but want to get out of the house and just need something with low responsibility but high social interaction   once you got a few years and a few  raises under your belt you went on to better pay and better skill jobs either during or after college   the problem now is that those better skill jobs havent opened back up since    so the only jobs that are available are the ones that are  an hour or less  technically above minimum wage but not liveable and certainly not ones that demand the skills college grads and mids or older already possess   so if the only jobs that companies are willing to hire for are the lowskill minimum wage positions without much hope of raises or even promotions since a lot of companies have severed the wage increase from the title promotion then those jobs damn well better pay enough that a single person can support themselves without having to rely on anyone else   if you work a second job in order to save up money to better your situation great   if you get a roommate in order to save up money to better your situation great   if you do either or both of those things because nobody is willing to pay enough to let you pay the rent and eat   no so great,0

4660,it most definitely is  how could it be construed as not some form of terrorism  they are holding the very interests of america hostage until they get their demands met  they are willing to let the economy crash and for americans of course minus the wealthy americans suffer until they get their demands met   i hope that history and americans are wise enough to judge these people as what they are traitors  in every sense of the word  they have turned their backs on their countrys best interests their constituents the history of america and are abusing their positions to kowtow to the needs of the wealthy exclusively    that is terrorism  ive said it before and ill say it again the gop has done more damage to america than any terrorist organization in our lifetimes  yes al qaeda had caused more life loss but the gop has ruined the lives of millions of people and continue by fighting exclusively for the wealthy and corporations taking food from the mouths of the need the elderly the young and the more damage they do the more pride they seem to take in it   jesus i wish we could split the country into two separate nations  id love to see how long the poor fools of gop land last after they become enslaved to corporations and the rich  there would be slavery again without doubt there would be a nation of  impoverished all struggling to help make profits for the  of the wealthy   fuck the gop  and fuck the uneducated uninformed people who cling to the both sides are the same mantra  you understand absolutely nothing about politics the economy history or anything else that has to do with whats going on right now in america,1

5394,this is why it infuriates me when people on reddit use that tired old comment about atheists being just as bad as religious zealots    really    witch killings enoch adeboye is an evangelical pastor from nigeria who promotes the existence of witches and wizards resulting in the torture and death of young children and others in nigeria the wider african continent and has also spread into europe  see ref on christmas day  yearold kristy bamu was found by paramedics in the bathroom of an east london highrise flat  his body had been mutilated teeth were missing and he was covered in deep cuts and bruising  he had been starved and deprived of water and sleep punched and kicked repeatedly floor tiles smashed over his head his teeth knocked out with a hammer and a pair of pliers had been used to twist his ear  in the last four days of his life he had suffered acts of unspeakable savagery viciously inflicted upon him by a man he called uncle and one of his own sisters   why  because eric bikubi and magalie bamu the boys family members were convinced that he was a witch   debbie ariyo executive director of africans unite against child abuse   explains that a boom in pentecostal churches was leading to more children being accused of witchcraft  an average of eight children a year in greater london are victims of abuse based on witchcraftstyle exorcisms but this only reflects cases resulting in police investigations   according to uk church statistics  pentecostal churches opened between  and  taking the total to   that figure is expected to rise to  by   as a result ariyo fears that witchbranding will increase   it is spreading like bushfire because it is a source of income says ariyo  if you can charge  for an oil that is going to cure a child of evil spirits you are going to make money  whilst adeboyes primary aim may be to exert power over his congregation and to extort money from relatives for cures many people take the matter into their own hands  his preaching will increase the likelihood of people in a segment of the australian community being accused of witchcraft by radical evangelicals  subsequently this will increase the chance of acts of torture and murder being committed like the case in the uk referred to above  if torture and murder are the result of this sort of evangelical preaching in a developed western nation like england then there is every reason to expect heinous acts to be committed here if the australian government grants access to this man known for hatemongering acts of evil and causing great harm to others   see ref and  anti homosexuals adeboye is currently campaigning from the pulpit for a proposed nigerian law making same sex marriage an offence punishable by up to  years in prison  additionally he is increasing the danger to anyone seen as being progay potentially causing journalists to be too afraid to report the truth  in effect if not intentionally adeboyes campaigning will essentially lead to the outlawing of organizations that provide services for gay people including hivaids clinics  the nigerian antigay law has already been passed by both houses of parliament  in addition to criminalising same sex marriage it also punishes public displays of same sex affection by up to ten years jail   the bill is only awaiting the presidents signature to become law  the u s  ambassador to nigeria has said that enoch adeboye is not in line with international human rights laws   there are serious concerns in the australian community that some of adeboyes ignorant vulnerable congregation will interpret what he is saying samesex marriage is an anathema to the will of god to mean that it is gods will for them to rid the world of homosexuals    see ref and ,0

6590,so the solution to that is having constant upward pressure by creating money out of nothing that is constantly inflating since any deflation is catastrophic  because that is often the conclusion of the keynesiannew economics argument that you began   people need wealth to trade for other wealth  but when our central banking system is such that new money can be printed to drive down interest rates allowing companies to expand and raise wages faster than they would otherwise have been able to and pay for government programs that fall short in budgeting the balance is thrown off  there is new money in the system but the same amount of wealth  it works great at first creating a boom  but eventually the market catches up with the fact that people are trading more paper money for the same amount of stuff and you have a contraction or a bust   it is often hard to argue against your statement in a populist setting since what you said is essentially true  if people have more money they can spend more money  but what you have not taken into account is what french economist frederic bastiat called what is seen and what is unseen  i would reccomend reading his essay of the same name and seriously considerin its implications  i used to think along the same lines as you until i read it   i would also point out that it is small and medium sized businesses that create jobs  new businesses are therefore the best path to future job creation  however you seem to be possibly indirectly arguing that demand side limitations is what hinders this  as someone actively trying to start a business right now i can tell you that demand side has no effect on my business plan as i only intend to sell my product for  which is what i believe the market can handle  jumping through all the regulatory hoops is killing me though  just one quick example out of many if i want to set up my business as an llc in order to secure business loans and give myself a layer of protection in massachusetts i have to pay a  registration fee  then every single year after that i would have to pay an additional  fee for the privledge of filing my annual report with the state  this annual report serves noones bennefit but the states i might add    if you want new jobs to be created quickly remove all the regulations hindering small business development  and if you dont believe that its that bad i would invite you to to ahead and try starting a business yourself,0

7284,yeah the notion that any party would die is pretty absurd anyway in the end you just have constituencies shuffle around a bit but the republican and democrat parties wont go anywhere anytime soon   i do think that the tea party could die as a result of this though or at least be cut off from the mainstream republican party that they have latched onto   the problem is that the fringe tea party members in the public seem to think that they really are the majority but since they arent theyre likely to overstep the bounds of public opinion like they are currently doing with the shutdown over obamacare   the mainstream republicans are trying to bail them out right now to cover their own ass but i think once the republicans lose the next presidential election due to all the infighting in their party spurred on by the tea part that they will stop placating the tea party and start fighting it for real   if theyre smart they could shun the tea party and make them the right wing party to the democrats left wing party while presenting the classic mainstream republican party as the moderate party,0

7857,from user tilio who deleted his comment after realizing how stupid it wasas the other side of independent i feel the exact opposite  were  trillion in debt with over  trillion in unfunded liabilities medicare is once again almost bankrupt  instead of making efforts to work these down democrats are piling on even more debt  its clear that many democrats  fiscal authoritarians have not looked at this from our point of view  republicans tea and fiscal conservatives in general want spending cuts and deficit reduction  as long as we stand firm we win  either democrats cave to our demands giving us the spending cuts we want or democrats drive us off the cliff destroying the us credit rating forcing spending cuts because they wont be able to borrow nearly as much money  the only way we lose is to agree to let democrats  fiscal authoritarians to keep spending  you may dislike this point of view  but it is inescapable fact   your joking right   that debt is largely a legacy of the last president and his two wars which we had to continue   conservative fiscal ideas are what drove us over the edge   furthermore we know your position but you lost the majority of voters elected representatives that support the aca as evidenced by the wast of time that the republicans tried to remote on it and lost every time   this is a democracy just because the majority disagrees with you doesnt mean you get to shut down government and act like a bunch of spoiled children,1

8376,i am so sick and tired of the whole media cabal bullshit excuse   the notion that the solution to the supposed problem is to fire  of editors and hire ones you cant control is just plainly stupid     there are surely sources of news that are better than others   if you rely on hour cable news channels like cnn msnbc and fox news as your sole sources of news then yes  you deserve constant ridicule   if you get your news from fucking blogspam sites where recycled news is mashed up and force fed back to you you deserve being ignored   if you get all your political news from one political perspective you could not care less about opposing views and it is pointless to engage you in a factoriented discussion   those people are the problem   theyre the ones that resort to making claims of mainstream media bias which they use as a security blanket to avoid actual discussion  but what about us readers who rely on several sources to make our conclusion   on syria for example i read the washington post guardian reuters ap al jazeera cnn com and several other sources   i heard about the administrations claims of intelligence implicating the syrian regime of putins claims that it was the rebels i followed the u n s report findings through the washington post   i followed the story as obama brought it to congress the proscons the opinion polls arguments for and against a strike the videos of children dying from the sarin   i am more informed these days than ever before so this disgruntled guys claims ring hollow   he just comes across as some pissed off guy   a cynic without a compelling argument   the point is i am grateful for all these news sources and am not convinced by indignant people like hersh that theyre all in the pockets of obama   let me ask you this mr  hersh  what publication is your shining example of journalism   you sure as hell didnt say   who sets the standard on reporting excellence   well the guardian lends you credibility by noting your pulitzer prize   youre one of the good guys   so who else is winning this prestigious prize in the area of international reporting that he later derides in the article     from the past decade     ny times     ny times     ny times     washington post     ny times     washington post     wall street journal     new york times     la times and newsday     washington post     washington post     dispatch news service seymour m  hersh  so my two most preferred publications nyt amp wp dominate the pulitzer prize for international reporting   fire  of these editors   its trite nothingness   any fool can cast stones at an entire profession but how about he put his money where his mouth is and call out some articles some editors some authors   he indicates a systemic problem but cant even get close to substantiating it   seriously those who agree with mr  hersh  what news source is your beacon of truth   what organizations and people are the standard bearers that the rest of the pathetic media should aspire to be   i really want to know because this type of bullshit generalization is a cheap and empty tactic,0

10474,the argument has some serious anachronisms that prevent it from being as effective as it could be   to begin with the word protest deriveshttpwww etymonline comindex php termprotest from the word protestari from latin which meant avowal pledge solemn declaration   the first usagehttpwww etymonline comindex php termprotestampallowedinframe as statement of disapproval is attested in  and is very clearly related to the sideeffects of some of the more radical offshoots of the protestant reformation   however the contemporary sense at the time was very clearly that it was a solemn declaration of reformation of the church around the gospels message not as a call to be always criticizing everything that isnt us like this article seems to imply   that anachronism is borne out when we examine what the th century reformers actually did   the majority of the protestant reformers specifically set out a vision of an evangelical catholic church that corrected the errors they were protesting   furthermore they generally retained the creeds and church fathers and taught there is one holy catholic and apostolic church   the clear intention was only to repair the unity of the church around the gospels promise which felt had been disrupted by the abuses in the medieval church   therefore this is why most protestants are not protestants like this article describes as the article itself noted   the notion of reformational catholicism is already inherent in most nonradical protestant philosophies   there were of course many radicals who sought to continue the reforms in ways that were against the original intent of the reformers   these radicals were clearly criticized by these same reformers however,0

11097,reading the bible should not make anybody an atheist  the bible never tries to prove that god exists  it takes gods existence as true   i dunno  i think there are plenty parts of the bible that are construed as arguments    hell theres a sense in which any claim thats made about the world is an argument  and theres some evidence that ancient texts in the hebrew bible and elsewhere were written to advance a particular theological view or even to argue that insert phenomenon was in fact not a natural event but a divinelysanctioned one   i mean nowhere is this sort of argumentation any clearer than in the epistles of paul  while in some places he assumes an audience familiar with certain aspects of judaism we know that his churches were significantly gentilic  he would have to totally convince them of the reality of a deity that they did not previously embracebelieve in ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature invisible though they are have been understood and seen through the things he has made  in acts the author has paul challenging epicurean and stoic philosophers and trying to convince athenians to embrace the gospel   further the gospels themselves are structured and have many motifs that were meant to appeal to gentiles to the extent of downplaying jesus judaism,0

12899,the problem is actually much worse  unemployment among young people is at a level that would have been considered a crisis on par with the depression  in    fixes are not as easy as raising the minimum though we have a much broader work force almost all women work outside the home which was less the case in  and much less demand for labor do to automation and computers   its not just factory jobs either we have tons of software solutions that render human labor far less necessary heck even the humble voice mail is a job killer   so while raising the minimum wage and even indexing it is fair its not going to help very much and might even speed up automation since robotics are getting better by the day   there is an  ethical solution social credit pay everyone a base wage combined with  a distributive  economic system changing the system to incentivize distribution within the middle tier but they are politically difficult to get into play   also both require big changes a much smaller military trade controls  and deep limits to immigration which have other issues   and note the current solution of social democracy doesnt work well  europe has it and also has heavy youth unemployment and low birth rates  its not as bad as actual marxism  fail by volume but it doesnt seem to resolve the problem  its slows the bleeding but it doesnt heal the body   i think and i do not know that the above might work  if it doesnt well as aaron cleary puts it enjoy the decline,0

14568,i am a youth minister  to some comments in this thread id like to respond  youth ministry may have been absurd in jesus day youre right it didnt exist  and it doesnt exist now see the andrew root article linked below neither did adolescence and neither did the deep nuanced culture our youth find themselves facing every day  now it isnt our job to prop up or indulge adolescence quite the opposite  andrew root goes into detail on that huge point herehttpwww faithformationlearningexchange netuploadsymdoesntexist pdf yes youth ministry as a segregated congregation of youths that can be fully understood by itself is not the church  yes a youth ministry that is a babysitting service or making church a carnival so the kids wont leave or making it a funeral so they wont mess up the church with their hijinks is bad  yes like any other part of the church bastardizing the gospel for the ease of those inside or for our own ideas of success youth can be bad  but there is a theology of youth ministry thanks to folks like kenda creasy dean www kendadean com and  andrew root www andrewroot org that teaches us how to minister rightly to those adolescents in our congregations    absolutely i think youth ministry must be intergenerational  as pastor i am facilitator of relationships and member of relationships  youth ministry is not the oneeared mickey mouse modelhttpwww abpnews comblogwpcontentuploadsoneearedmickey jpg but firmly placed and integrated with the larger church  at my church our youth group acts as small group  we have our own worship on wednesday where they learn to lead and create and engage to find their voice and get content and contextualize but we also do everything the greater church does  taking youth ministry away and assuming that this assimilation will magically happen otherwise because theres no other option is sad for church kids and disastrous for unchurched kids    youth ministry is letting the children come to jesus i am a pastor at my church who focuses on youth not a pastor solely for youth  with someone there to invest in them and relate to them they have the full access an adult has to someone to disciple them and help them in their journey with god  someone who has been to seminary has made this their lifes work not just someone doing it to help out  not that thats the endall but its what our adults get isnt it    my teenagers are equipped they are within the larger church they are called to be fully christian just like adults  im not raising diet disciples  they are given adult mentors from the congregation  and they are living into that    also quick word on things like divided  divided comes with a lot of theological baggage and is almost predicated on the idea that the youth minister is a usurper of the fathers sovereign power over his family as the male leader  there are many more informed voices speaking on this subject who will raise better objections and questions and leave us with better answers    i agree youth ministry must not become a golden calf but it absolutely exists because of the way culture has designed itself  it is human person to human person relationship in christ  it is not to be just one more problematic segregation in the church but just because we give it a name doesnt mean it has to something other than just ministry ,0

15253,of course the obama administration is to blame for the botched rollout but there are other culprits getting less attention  namely global tech conglomerate cgi which was responsible for the bulk of the execution and in general the ability of big corporations to get massive taxpayerfunded contracts without enough accountability  government outsourcing to private contractors has exploded in the past few decades  taxpayers funnel hundreds of billions of dollars a year into the chosen companies pockets about bn of which goes to tech companies  weve reached a stage of kneejerk outsourcing of everything from intelligence and military work to burger flipping in federal building cafeterias and its damaging in multiple levels  for one thing farming work out often rips off taxpayers  while the stereotype is that government workers are incompetent timewasters drooling over their texas instruments keyboards as they amass outsized pensions studies show that keeping government services in house saves money  in fact contractor billing rates average an astonishing  more than what it would cost to do the work inhouse  hiring workers directly also keeps jobs here in the us while contractors especially in the it space can ship taxpayerfunded work overseas  fortunately then there are alternatives to outsourcing public functions to big corporations padding their profits at taxpayers collective expense and it is time we used them   click thru for more,0

17806,fucking a guys the only reason we have been winning elections is because we appear normal compared to the tea party  i dont necessarily like clinton but she would win  ensuring that the supreme court would be dominated by liberals for the foreseeable future  it would be easier for a liberal supreme court to overrule previous rulings like citizen united than it would for congress which will remain divided due to the republican gerrymandering of crucial swing states that allow them to hold the house despite losing the popular vote  the greatest strength republicans had until  was that they fell in line  this is what democrats have done since then and it has allowed us to hold the presidency along with the senate  elizabeth warren is to the democrats as ted cruz is to the republicans they represent the the beliefs of the base but do not reflect the attitudes of the general electorate which despite obamas election and reelection remains centreright  all she would do is hurt hillary in the primary by forcing hillary to move further to the left just as santorum and gingrich forced romney to move further and further to the right  winning the  election is all that matters  fall in line  the day will come when we can elect a candidate like senator warren but it is not this day  dont confuse me for a moderate as i fall into the british school of economics and would like nothing more than to see a reimplementation of new deal fiscal policy but our current political climate will not allow that and losing the presidency would allow republicans to cut more programs than we are seeing now with obama    we have to hold the line  look at the big picture,0

18402,yeah i have to say as a moderate that if i saw this slideshow it would shift me to the right   there are useful and detrimental forms of biblical criticism  your slide glibly defends them all by painting your opponents as all representing a single position literalism and arguing criticism is superior  well as a moderate im no literalist but depending what criticism you are talking about it sure is preferable   law and gospel is spread throughout both testaments sometimes within the same verse your slide shows a complete misunderstanding of walther and therefore lutheranism  furthermore to write off a part of the cannon is marcionism an ancient heresy httpen wikipedia orgwikimarcionism  remember that your pro life brethren understand abortion to be murder  if you want to try to convince them you are going to need an argument where you can replace the word abortion for murder in the argument and it will still be persuasive  im not saying you have to believe its murder im saying you have to know your audience   actually the issue of homosexuality is not remotely controversial in places where the church is growing like east asia and north africa  its a major issue in the us and europe  try again without writing off  of all christians in your answer   there are two sides to the final argument you miss both of them and presume the problem is that they dont understand the way to accomplish a liberal political agenda is through liberalism   side  the political causes i think are most important are things like addiction recovery missions to closed countries and family values consistent with all the things you named but represented in this country by the opposite political party as the one this church is supporting   side  i dont think the church institution should be supporting any political agenda at all i think that is a job for christians but not churches the church has lost focus on the important things like the sacraments,0

19430,as the only socially transformational legislation in modern american history to be enacted on a straight partyline vote obamacare is wholly owned by the democrats  its unraveling would catastrophically undermine their underlying ideology of everexpansive central government providing cradletograve care for an evergrateful citizenry  for four years this debate has been theoretical  now its real  and for democrats its a disaster  this is the signature legislative achievement of the obama presidency the embodiment of his new entitlementstate liberalism  if obamacare goes down there will be little left of its underlying ideology  perhaps it wont go down  perhaps the web portal hums beautifully on nov    perhaps theyll find a way to restore the canceled policies without wrecking the financial underpinning of the exchanges  perhaps  the more likely scenario however is that obamacare does fail  it either fails politically renounced by a wide consensus that includes a growing number of democrats or it succumbs to the financial complications the insurance death spiral of the very amendments desperately tacked on to save it  if it does fail the effect will be historic  obamacare will take down with it more than mary landrieu and co  it will discredit obamas new liberalism for years to come ,0

20322,ive read boswells books both of them  christianity social tolerance and homosexuality is a bit better but samesex unions in premodern europe is an exercise in wishful thinking  im sympathetic i have many of the same wishes but it is  whats interesting is that if you read more than the dust jacket he basically admits as much arguing that while these relationships were meant to be celibate they probably didnt all live up to the ideal and that this created a social niche for homosexual men while not being exclusive to them  im not sure i like his reading but even his own position at least as i could discern it at the time this was ages ago has a bit more subtlety than omg ancient gay marriages ,0
