25034,stossel is a piece of rancid cat shyte   heres a good rule of thumb for what should be privatized and what shouldnt    if you want to control the outcome of a given situation then socialization is the way to go    the whole raison detre for private enterprise is to make money not provide whatever outcome you desire        lets use the example of a sewage system    the outcome you want is basic sanitation for obvious reasons  now you can give that job to government where the entire enterprise is set up to provide the service without having to make a profit   if you give that job to private business their entire purpose is to make money    making money takes precedence over providing the service    one of the primary ways to make money for the private enterprise is to not provide the service   so when the outcome matters its best to pool our resources as a society and bring down the price of the outcome we desire   stossel and other conservatives ignorereject this simple concept in the vague hopes that someone will be able to take more money from the american taxpayer than the government would in taxes to provide the service in the mistaken belief that privitazation generates more economic growth    which even if true does not negate that   if privatization works so great where are the all too obvious examples    halliburton isnt exactly a poster child for spending taxpayer dollars efficiently is it   the guys who lost their radioactive fracking waste along a texas highway   the ones who said theres no reason to hold down costs because theyre all passed onto taxpayers,0

26122,its not surprising that this article takes an antiinvestor stance and is chock full of misleading information   its a slow day at work today so i thought id write a few bullet points as i was reading through it    blackstone isnt owned by any of those banks listed   the fancy sounding sec filing is just a list of who owns blackstones common stock ticker bx   the list includes all of the mutual funds those companies manage which means if you as a normal person buy for example the jpmorgan large cap value mutual fund you own a portion of those bx shares which gets aggregated in that list   not so evil     the reason that real estate agent is seeing less minority buyers is because the lending standards have gotten tighter and safer   there are no more zero money down purchases   if you blame the crash on the banks giving these easy money loans then you cant also blame them for now not giving these loans      the besuited businessmen paying cash are not swooping in and taking homes from hard working immigrants who are about to close   these companies like blackstone are buying houses out of foreclosure directly from banks or at large auctions   not so evil      after buying the houses they are hiring property management companies contractors and repair men to get the houses back into rentable condition as quickly as possible within  days   thats literally thousands of blue collar people being put to work in areas that need it most      blackstone isnt speculating on housing prices looking to quickly flip them or creating another housing bubble   the key reason this is not true is because they are not building new construction properties   these are all houses that already exist and they are simply fixing them back up and allowing people to move back into them in an affordable way      most of the people that were foreclosed upon are not able to get a new mortgage right now   they dont have  savings to put down they are probably living check to check   but their family and kids are used to living in a house in a neighborhood   they dont want to move into a  bedroom apartment building   now blackstone comes in and offers the opportunity to stay in a house with the same schools etc   this isnt predatory   people are paying rent but now they have the option to do so while living in a house      now that all these houses are owned by blackstone they are in no hurry to flip them for profit because they are making a profit monthly by simply holding onto them and renting them   the new boilers new roof and general maintenance is all factored into the profitability   most leases are  years so there isnt constant turnover and people are more likely to care for the houses with a decent respect        eventually the ownership of these houses will likely be split off into a separate company and stock will be sold to people that want to own real estate without doing the work see the recent ipo of silverbaysby   the company will continue to own and operate the homes pay income to shareholders and the stock value will increase in value when the homes do   the exact same thing has happened for years and years in commercial real estate and multifamily apartment real estate investing   not so evil   ultimately this is actually making it easier for lower income people to live in homes   while renting they can continue to save and eventually buy a house with lending terms that are sustainable for their budget   hopefully this response is helpful to readers that actually want to understand what blackstone and other institutional investors are doing rather than just shake their fists and yell damn wall street republicans and obama    there was a lot of anecdotal malarkey at the end of the article which is where i stopped reading,0
